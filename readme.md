> We (Scott and I) are looking forward to chatting a little later, and we are going to be doing a live coding exercise. 
> 
> You will be free to use your framework of choice, or just vanilla javascript if that's what you prefer. It is totally up to you. We just wanted to give you a heads up so hopefully you can have a fresh project up and running. 
> 
> You can use StackBlitz or the Editor/IDE of your choice.  We will also need you to be able to share your screen. 
> 
> A bit before the interview I will send you a screenshot/mock and you will be tasked with bringing it to life.  Let us know if you have any questions!  Thanks!
